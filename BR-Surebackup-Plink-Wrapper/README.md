## Project Notes
**Author:** Timothy Dewin

**Function:** Allows you to verifiy a linux VM with plink

**Requires:** Tested against VBR 9.5 but might work with any version. Tested with plink 0.62 but might work with any version

**Usage:** Schedule the script via the Application Group or via the "Surebackup" job > "Linked Job" section. This example tests if a file exists or not but you can of course alter the example. Will automatically send "yes" to stdin so that the "new ssl signature" (masked ip) is automatically accepted. This does not seems to cause issue on subsequent runs. The wrapper makes sure that a proper exit code is propagated to Surebackup

**Parameters:**
* -plink "C:\bin\plink.exe"
	* Default "C:\bin\plink.exe" ; location of plink
* -ip %vm_ip%
	* What is the masked IP of the server, use %vm_ip% in the surebackup setup.
* -fexist "/root/hellodarknessmyoldfriend.txt"
	* What file should be checked, by default an awkward document name that should never exist on a server
* -username root
	* What account to use to do the test
* -password mysupersecretpass
	* What password to use
* -logpref "[linuxfexist]"
	* Default "[linuxfexist]" will make sure that write-hosts will be prefixed so you can easily find the output in the logs
* -timeout 30
	* Kills plink if it doesn't stop after 30 seconds (for example incorrect pass)
